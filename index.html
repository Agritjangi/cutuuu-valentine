    My Cutuuu,<br><br>

    Some souls don’t arrive loudly.<br>
    They sit across the table, eyes half closed,<br>
    and somehow the world feels quieter just by being there.<br><br>

    I’ve seen you in stillness and in laughter,<br>
    in crowded rooms and passing lights,<br>
    and every version feels like home finding me again.<br><br>

    This isn’t a question made of roses,<br>
    but of moments, patience, and choosing you gently.<br><br>

    Tap the paw below.
